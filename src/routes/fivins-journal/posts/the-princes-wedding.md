## Da-leysen - 14th of Thunsheer, Year 1163

The morning of the wedding has finally arrived. Myself and Zan woke up early and enjoyed a cup of coffee. Kyburn didn't wait long to be ready either as an armed escorted soon arrived to take the musical duo to the ceremony. This left Matthias, Malus, and myself to get ready.

A couple of hours later and we arrived at the commoner entrance. Malus dressed very similar to myself in indistinct clothing. We look well enough to blend in and avoid any major attention. I, of course, was able to hide my armor underneath the baggy clothing - one can never be too careful at a gathering of highly influential people. 

The wedding itself went off without anything to get excited about. Matthias was able to do some networking. I'm not sure what he was looking for but I hope he found it. Malus seemed to be busy? I didn't see him much, I assume he spent his time looking for any foul play. And of course, the music was fantastic. I particularly liked the new mole song.
