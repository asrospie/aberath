### *From the journal of Fivin Njork*

# Conthsen - 11th of Thunsheer, Year 1163

The noise ended up being the vandals that we were expecting. They arrived wearing black cloaks over the heads that hid their weapons. It appeared as though Matthias was about to say something when I noticed one of the figures reach in their cloak. Experience has taught me that this was rarely a good sign. 

I started the fighting with a swift strike to the shoulder of the man drawing a weapon. It wasn't intended to kill as I was hoping to scare him enough that they would back off. This had the opposite effect as a rather intense battle began. I was focused on using my rapier in a strategic fashion, dashing in and out of combat to deliver strikes to unsuspecting targets. Matthias put his gifts from Nyx to good use as he buffed, distracted, and even hit a few people. Kyburn's musical talents also inspired us to do more. We all felt the power of that damned mole song. Then there was Malus and Zan.

Malus and Zan fought as opposites. The large armored man dove strait into battle, often blocking or shoving aside attacks as though they were harmless. It was almost as impressive as his skills with magic as a spiritual weapon of sorts ripped its way through the battle. Zan, on the other hand, used his arcane knowledge to blast foes from afar. This was a strange sort of magic... something like I've only seen a couple of times. 

Somewhere halfway into the battle, all hell broke loose. One of the men seemed to transform into what I later figured was a lesser devil. Malus, unsurprisingly, went straight for the towering beast. He eventually went down with some timely spells from the spellcasters. 

The aftermath of the battle was something else entirely. Out of the six figures that walked into the temple that night, only two remained alive. There would have been more had Malus not smited two poor souls into hell. I can't say I blame him, I may have done the same thing. The two living men only remained that way from the pleading of Zan and Matthias. After a brief discussion with a man named Robert, we headed to their lair in the woods. 

-- *Early Morning*

Either devils are more in control of people than I thought, or Robert and Dill are two of the dumbest people I've ever met. It turns out that the two of them and there three other friends barely knew each other and blindly did whatever the devil said. Of course they didn't know he was a devil, but it just makes everything more confusing. 

The lair itself was an abandoned mine-shaft with only one entry and exit. It provided us shelter in the night after we let Robert go to try and live a better life. The morning after, Matthias and I left to help clean up the temple, which ended up being cleaned by the people of Nyx. 

-- *Afternoon*

Later in the day, we arrived in time to see Kyburn and Zan try out for playing music in the wedding. There performance was outstanding. I have never heard a performance more beautiful and inspiring than that. Of course, they will never hear that from my mouth, but it was truly something to be proud of. 

Almost on cue, the Prince Heinz Kuttener arrived on horseback praising the duo. He even knew Kyburn by name as a bard from the Jade Coast... I wasn't aware I was traveling with a man of his renown. It was because of his interaction with the Prince that our group was invited to his wedding and reception.
