### *Zan's Tome* 

# Thunsheer, 9.

Finally made it to Willington. If it was any farther away I just might have been able to solve the grand mystery of where exactly one goes after death. Malus never seems to stop working. We were in town for all of five minutes before he began his systematic interrogation of the inebriated masses, searching for the evil arcane from beyond our world. This is probably the last place a demon would be hiding; Willington is a picturesque little town between two forests and a beautiful river. If there are demons here, they at least have good taste. I came by some fellow travelers in the tavern known as the Rusted Shield. There was a group of three consisting of a tiefling fellow with a lute, a half elf with a fantastic taste in coffee, and a human male in their company. I managed to hustle 3 gold today with a knife throwing game. That half elf has a keen eye for the arcane, he is the first person to catch my trick. I won with dumb luck regardless. The stars are wondrous tonight.

Apparently there is a grand wedding of sorts tomorrow, seems to be the talk of the town. Kyburn seems particularly interested, I wonder if he's well known by the nobility of Freidal. I decided to spend some time with these new guys. Malus and I went to the armory, Fivin and Kyburn tagged along. On the way, I got that pearl I needed. Apparently some anti-god vandalism occured. Malus led us to the town guard where we learned of a man with a 500 gold bounty by the name of Mark Mills. His bounty was suspiciously high for what he was being accused of. I'd be interested in hearing his side of things should we successfully capture him. The Crooked Nail tavern may be a place to start, according to the bartender at the Rusted Shield. Matthias, it turns out, is actually here in Willington specifically in regard to the vandalism that has plagued the temple of Nix. Quite honestly I have nothing better to do and this might be my ticket to a 500 gold bounty in the off chance that Mark Mills is involved, so I might as well help out. The stars are luminous tonight.

That stake out didn't pan out the way I had hoped. At least Malus found what he was looking for.
