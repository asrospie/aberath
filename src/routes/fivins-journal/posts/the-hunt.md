### *From the journal of Fivin Njork*

## Folsen - 12th of Thunsheer, Year 1163

Today we hunted down the orc known as Hundeer. Reports were going around the town that he was attacking wanderers to the north. The townsguard contracted us to put a stop to it before the prince's wedding.

--

We made it to the forest in question before lunch break. It was not long until we encountered Aisha, a druid of the woods. She would later become a key ally.

--

Aisha led us on the path to find the hunter. On the way we stopped to helpp a large treant named Rootberry, from being attacked by three lycantrhopic boars. The battle was fierce and quick. I don't remember much of it except for Aisha staving off blow after blow while attempting to put out the fire raging on Rootberry.

--

We later found Hundeer setting up a ritual to rid himself of the disease. After talking with him to allow us to help, we defeated three spectral boars to cure him. Despite his crimes, Rootberry advised us that the hunter would be better kept serving the woods as he once did. We have kept him in our debt in case the group needs to call on him in the future.

## Yulisen - 13th of Thunsheer, Year 1163

We arrived in town quickly with our lent horses. The sergeant was not easily convinced that we took care of the treant. However, we managed to recover half of the bounty.

At the Rusty Shield, the groupo was reunited with Matthias who returned from his work at the temple of Nyx. The day ended with some drinnks and stories shared around the table.

This past couple odf days was particularly hard on me. I'm not sure why but I have a feeling things are going to change. I have an especially bad feeling about the wedding. The necessary preparations have already been made should something happen.
