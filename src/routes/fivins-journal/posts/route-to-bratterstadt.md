## Whelson - 3rd of Unndilar, Year 1163

The group arrived in Fairmarsh in the afternoon. It had been a couple of weeks since Matthias, Kyburn, and myself had been here though nothing seemed to change. There were still halflings all over growing their hops and Gilbert seemed to be fixing up his farm just fine. 

The Deeproot Tavern was our next stop for food, drink, and rest. It didn't take long for the other boys to make friends with some locals and head to bed. 

## Conthsen - 4th of Unndilar, Year 1163

Our stop in Fairmarsh was short lived. Malus sensed no devils around and agreed with the rest of us that it was time for the long haul North to Bratterstadt. 

Bratterstadt is somewhere that I have never been. I've been told that it is one Freidal's largest and most populous cities. Surely there will be much to discover there. Hopefully a way to get stronger as well. Zan seems particularly excited to get to the city, I am unsure why at the moment.

## First Week of Travel

The first week of travel went by as quick as it could. The only notable encounter was that of an obelisk that was as tall as Matthias. It had a description of the Goddess of Sylvanas and had all the markings of being created by her worshippers.

This encounter opened up questioning from Matthias about my purpose for being here. He pushed harder than ever looking for information about my past and intentions. Perhaps he is almost ready. He's been proving himself as of late and will most likely figure it out on his own.

I pivoted this line of questioning to Zan, below is a list of notes I was able to take during our conversation (revisit later):
- Badly wounded, couldn't see anything, everyone was gone
- Could suddenly see again
- Evidence of ancient society
- Doesn't remember reading anything on cave walls
- Looking for people who obtain power in desperation

## Second Week of Travel

The weather took a turn for the second week as it began to rain nonstop. What was once an easy trek across the land for our horses became us trudging through the mud on the road. This has no doubt slowed our progress some.

About halfway through the week we encountered some shady figures clearly setting up an ambush on the road ahead. We prepared our weapons and went to work.

The gnolls weren't particularly strong nor smart combatants. I was even able to take one out with one swift strike. The rest of the group also fared impressively well. I have no doubt that our time together and recent experience has led to us being stronger and more cohesive in a fight. 

## Conthsen - 18th of Unndilar, Year 1163

Lunch time had just passed when we saw Bratterstadt on the horizon. Entering the city gates we saw lots of caravans as the city opened up to a market place full of interesting and new faces. Most of the houses stood taller than the towns from our previous adventures, all built of wood.

We had just got done speaking to a rather unpleasant salesmen when Zan suddenly took off in the air...flying. As expected in a large city, the guards immediately took after him. The group eventually caught up with him at the Stag Tavern & Inn where we would stay for our first night in the big city.
