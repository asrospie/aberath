This campaign is focused around the continent called Aberath. This vast land was once a singular kingdom long ago, but it fell to an unknown cause. While there are those who are still trying to learn the history of it; what is known is that it was a mighty kingdom, with knowledge and arcana even more advanced than what exists today. No one knows what exactly happened, but this kingdom did come to ruin, with all of its people and most of its secrets lost to time.

Now in its place exists three major countries, Freidal, Arcaria and Zustran, as well as two large swaths of land unclaimed by civilization, the Northern Reaches and the Wildlands. Each of the three countries are independent of one another, with different cultures, but not so incredibly different to necessarily feel foreign to one another. These countries have had disputes in the past, but at current times are at peace with each other. It is not uncommon to have people migrating between these countries, and each of these nations are home to many different races of humanoids.

# Arcaria

Beginning with Arcaria, this is a land that sits to the east, smallest of the three countries. Its culture has a great focus on education and magic. Many people there dedicate their lives to learning the magical arts and researching history, with a particular focus on the ancient kingdom of Aberath. They wish to uncover the great secrets of this bygone era through exploring ruins and analyzing archaic tomes. Though this is not everyone’s purpose in the land, the culture places much emphasis on education, and oftentimes those who do not seek such a path in life can find themselves pushed to the outskirts of society.

# Zustran

Next is the Empire of Zustran, home to a proud people whose culture values honor, courage, patriotism and service. Resting above both Arcaria and Freidal, Zustran shares a border to the north with the Northern Reaches, and The Wildlands to the West. These vast lands were not always a single country however. There were once many separate nations, but the one that was Zustran bred both strong ideals and warriors, which led a series of “Unification Wars” where they sought to share their prosperity with others... through annexation. They were quite successful in this endeavor, and all nations that once existed to the north have become united under the flag of Zustran; except for one. There still exists the sovereign nation of Drachma, a land of proud and fierce dragonborn folk. The rocky terrain of their homeland and might of their warriors have allowed them to continue to hold off Zustranian advances. This war is still current, and things aren’t looking great for Drachma, although they continue to hold on.

# Freidal

Lastly, there is the country of Freidal. The largest of the three countries, Freidal lies to the west with a significant amount of coast along the Laryon Ocean. This also was once a series of divided territories, each led by various noble families, but many years ago, the nobles decided to unite as one into the country of Freidal in order to deter invasion from the Empire of Zustran. Freidal’s culture attempts to pride itself on the idea of freedom, though there are many who would disagree with this notion, as the nobles have always ruled over the people, driving large inequities in both wealth and power. There is also rumor that corruption runs rampant throughout the government, but of course discussion of such things is rarely heard, as treason is a serious crime.

# Other Lands
    
As for the lands unclaimed by civilization, the Northern Reaches is a cold, mountainous snowscape whose harsh weather and difficult terrain make it home only to the most resilient of creatures. Rumors exist that great kingdoms of giants and powerful dragons lord over these lands, but sightings of such things are quite rare. To the west lies the Wildlands, a vast jungle where the powers of nature are rampant. Many strange and savage beasts roam these lands, fueled by wild magic and fey energy. The plants themselves can even be considerably dangerous in some areas, so most do not dare to venture into these woods, unless accompanied by experts. There are believed to be at least a handful of druidic peoples who would make the closest thing to civilization within these lands, though they do no often communicate with outsiders, nor leave the Wildlands
