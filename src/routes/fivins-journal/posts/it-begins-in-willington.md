# Grissen - 9th of Thunsheer, Year 1163

We arrived in Willington late on Grissen. I wasn't able to see much of the town before we hurried to the "Rusted Shield." It's a relatively standard tavern with a good deal of diversity in its clientele. Humans, halflings, elves, orcs, etc. were scattered around having a good time. I was especially happy to not be the only person above 5ft tall.

Matthias and Kyburn ushered us to a table after grabbing a few drinks. Kyburn seemed to be eager to play his recent try at a hit new song about the large landshark we faced two weeks prior. It took a while but thankfully Matthias and I were left to listen to the Shield's bard play a soothing rendition of a local song. Though I will say it didn't quite match the lively energy of the tavern goers.

It was not long from finally being able to sit down that we were interrupted by two, shall I say, interesting, men...

Zan looked to be human. He has long brown curly hair with a matching goatee. He wears a black and red suit with a cape hanging off his shoulder. The tall black top hat would be the most interesting thing about him if it were not for his strange Arcarian accent and his incidence on showing off his magical abilities. Zan also smells heavily of coffee.

His companion, Malus, stands towering above six feet wearing a full set of chain mail armor. The armor has clearly seen plenty of action. He wields a shield marked with an unfamiliar emblem that he later remarked was for some type of group called "The Watch". I will have to look to see if notes from my family have any mention of this group.

After a brief stare-down from across the tavern, Malus approached with Zan following. The armored man immediately began questioning us on demons, their whereabouts, and our potential involvement with them... he is a very forward man. After the interrogation ended with Kyburn, Mathias, and myself pushing the questions off, we relaxed and shared tales from our journeys. It appears, much like my newly-found acquaintances, that these two have also just recently met. It was then I finally decided that I needed a drink. I highly recommend the Port Storm iced tea.

I don't remember much of the rest of the night. Much of it was playing various tavern games and betting on said games. Kyburn, despite his small stature, was even able hold off Malas in an arm wrestling match that was able to gather quite the crowd. This was followed promptly by Zan trying to cheat at a game of throwing knives. It is clear that Zan is not a university man.

# Whelson - 10th of Thunsheer, Year 1163

I woke up earlier than all except Zan who apparently has the same interest in coffee as I. The rest of the morning went by quickly as we went about our business. When Matthias decided it was finally time for him to visit the Temple of Nyx, I, as well as Kyburn, opted to join Zan and Malus, our new friends, to shop around the town. 

While walking through town, I took the opportunity to get the lay of the land. Willington appears to be a fairly well off town. Though this may be due to the people preparing for a noble's wedding later in the week. A disgruntled man told me that Willington is a hot spot for nature themed weddings. I would have agreed with him if it were not for what we saw at the blacksmith.

"Faith is plague" was etched deep into the otherwise beautiful looking building. After questioning the blacksmith we found out that there is a group of low lives going around and terrorizing the more faith driven people. Though I myself don't follow the teachings of the divine, I respect those who devote their lives to a cause, especially a good one. We later learned that blacksmith follows Nyx. We then quickly made our way to the temple of Nyx, but was intercepted by Matthias. He shared stories of destruction at his temple.

The townsguard were not much help as they are focusing all of their resources on the security for the upcoming noble's wedding. We were only able to learn of a man named Mark Mills.

Mills, as it turns out, isn't a stand up guy. He is a wanted man for various counts of theft, aggravated assault and public intoxication. Despite his large list of grievances, the townsguard requested his bounty to be fulfilled with Mark left alive. 

Figuring there was nothing to lose, we also ventured to another temple that reported damage. Compared to the Temple of Nyx, there was next to no major damage. The lead priest seemed to be honest in his report, but I haven't ruled out any wrongdoing from him or others of his church. 

With this limited information, we decided it would be best to hide out in the Temple of Nyx's courtyard and wait for anything to happen. Matthias and I separated from the group to get some sleep before the night while the others went back to the town. Supposedly Kyburn and Zan put on a quite a show on the streets of Willington. Something tells me some magic was involved.

That leads to where I am now, waiting under Mathias's magical hideout hoping to catch some criminals in the act. Hopefully all goes... wait, I hear a noise from the gates...
