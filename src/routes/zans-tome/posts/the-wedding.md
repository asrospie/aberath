### *Zan's Tome* 

## Thunsheer, 12

The ranger Hundeer lives to fight another day, it seems. To my surprise, the four of us agreed that it would be best to spare him and simply tell the Willington guard what happened and that their problem is effectively solved. I was pleased with this outcome. Last time, at the Temple of Nix, we committed what I view as a moral atrocity in killing those people, despite being legally justified in doing so. We received no bounty for that either, so I could not take comfort in knowing that my financial stability would be an unintended yet welcome side effect of such a gut-wrenching action. This time, however, my moral conscience is clear, so even in the event of not receiving gold for this deed, I shall sleep comfortably. That said, we managed to obtain half of the promised bounty, which I view as quite generous considering we had what sounded like a children's fairytale of an explanation of the events that took place. A shapeshifting wolf woman, talking walking tree, deadly bushes that can kill you by being in your presence, magical fires that release flying spectral boars… it does sound quite ridiculous when one says it. Regardless, the wedding is tomorrow, and I’m looking forward to it. The stars are wondrous tonight. 

## Thunsheer, 13

The most accurate way I could describe the wedding experience is 8 hours of relentless, steadily worsening, nearly completely debilitating stress. I am coming to the realization that I am more terrified of public failure than I am of horrifying monstrosities out for my blood. I took comfort in the fact that Kyburn Jadespear is, perhaps, one of the most gifted musicians around. At the same time, the mere thought of making a mistake that ruins his performance left me nauseated. By some act of the gods, I managed to go the entire evening without any disastrous error on my part. 
Although what I’m truly ecstatic about is that tomorrow the bookstore/library will be open. I’m dying to see what I can uncover, and once I have that, I’ll be on my way. I can hardly contain myself in the excitement given the potential of locating answers to my burning questions. These stars need to get out of my sight so that it can be tomorrow for gods' sake.
