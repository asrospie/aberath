### *Zan's Tome* 

## Thunsheer

Well, it’s decided. I will be banding together with Malus, Matthias, Kyburn, and Fivin for the time being. We seem to have been recognized by a noble from a city north of Ashington (or, as he would say, fromacitynortho’ashington). Seems as though we might have some honest work that lines up with our collective skillset. 
I also retract every positive thing I have said about this dump of a town since arriving. Their book selection is so painfully sparse and irrelevant that I would sooner use the pages to cleanse my behind and stoke a fire if they didn’t cost their own weight in gold. I am no closer to my goal after investigating their entire selection. But at least I have two things to read on the way to Braderstat. Since I didn’t end up spending much of my gold, I bought Matthias a riding horse. I honest to the gods believe that this man would have traveled all the way there on a pig if it saved him a copper piece, and I refused to proceed at his pace. Really I just want to see how he does his magic and why it’s so different from the way I do it. Perhaps we shall see. 

Zan then chronicles their travels, making note of the mannerisms of his traveling companions as well as some of the monsters they avoided fighting. He goes on:

Matthias and I have something surprising in common. It seems we both lost our parents at around the same age, although it affected us very differently. My perception of Ashington is very different after speaking with him on the matter. I thought it was a glorious institution for research, but I now understand collective glory can leave people behind. I was taken care of when I lost them; Matthias was not. Yet he seems to be a changed man, given how he described his childhood.  And he was given a divine purpose it seems. We’re both figuring out exactly what to do next. 

As for Kyburn, he seems to be selling this beach thing. Because he seems to be one with the finer things in life, I would very much like to see the ocean one day. Having only read about it, I am certain experiencing this would be quite different. I also wonder what exactly a “dark and stormy” is. I’m genuinely concerned that it’s an innuendo for something.

I am starting to suspect the nature of my powers may be divine. Matthias provides credence to this theory as he is a new follower of Nyx and has been given immense arcane ability in a short amount of time. Perhaps a benevolent god took pity on me in my time of need. I shall investigate further in Fairmarsh. I will also seek more knowledge on Nyx. If she is responsible for the beauty of the night sky, then I honestly owe her thanks. The stars are stunning tonight.
