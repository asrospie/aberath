### From Kyburn

When I set out east, away from the Jade Coast, I left everything behind. My family, friends, colleges, and connections. I wanted to escape to monotony, and start something new for myself. Well I mean, that hooded weirdo in the tavern contributed to my departure as well. His voice, it still haunts me to this day. To be quite honest, this lot I've ran into along the way is...actually comforting. The arguing, joking, and fighting is nice and familiar in a way. Something akin to siblings bickering back and forth. I hate to admit it, but these goons helped me realize my goals of performing in front of high society. My gratitude is immense, but my words are limited due to my what I can assume to be my inflated ego. These people are the closest things I can equate to friends in, gods know how long. I finally find myself, at what seems to be at the crossroads of my career, and ultimately choosing to follow these lunatics to somewhere off yonder. To be completely fair, Willington was a small, backwater shithole anyway. I hope that guy from the tavern doesn't know where I am...
